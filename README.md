### Problem Statement
> Over the last 30 years, diabetes prevalence and incidence in the United States have been rising steadily, which has been putting the American people in an ever-worsening public health crisis. Combining California diabetes prevalence data from 2012-2018, alongside state-level diabetes indicator survey data, I plan to conduct a time series analysis and train models to predict future California diabetes prevalence rates. These predictions will inform policy on how to best allocate funds for diabetes prevention/awareness.

### Further Research and Data to Gather

* I would like to find data on California diabetes rates at the county level.
